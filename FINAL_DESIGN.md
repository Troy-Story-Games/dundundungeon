* Theme: __Underground__
* Modifier: __Deal with the devil, Next, and Breathtaking__

# Next - Player changes on each death

* Player character hat and arm black things change color. Player has serial number that also increments by one.
* Stretch goal - Previous run player is dead on the level they made it to
* Stretch goal - Different hats

# Breathtaking

* The starting area has to have a scenic view before you go in the dungeon

# Deal with the devil

* Cursed gun - it's just sitting there...why not pick it up?
* Half health, enemies are stronger can't pickup shield or sword...can't change your mind until you die. Unlimited ammo...no reloading 

# Underground

* We'll put the game underground.
* Starting room, outdoors scenic view, cave entrance...begine dungeon crawl. progressing to the next room by breaking the floor with the "finishing hammer" which you get after you clear the enemies
* Break hole in the floor, move to the next room by teleport movement
    * If they're playing with "glide" movement, we're not worried about them getting sick...they made their bed...they can just fall to the next floor.

* Drop into the center of the next room regardless of hole location
* Hole location exists in the level design - always in center - denoted by cracked floor texture.
* Hammer spawns on that block when enemies are cleared
* Starting area doesn't need to be cave entrance...can just be dungeon
* First dungeon room, no enemies...just a hammer a down arrow on the wall...and maybe some text that reads smash with a highlighted block or some indicator around the cracked floor bits

# Gameplay

* Turn based combat
* Attack and defense phase

* 3 weapons + cursed gun
    * Gun (curse)

    * mage staff

## Battles

### Need prototypes

* Battle room - one on one with enemy - take turns - is it fun?
* Room with a bunch of enemies and smashing and ragdolling

## Sword and Shield

### Defense

* Shield
   * Blocks ranged attacks
   * Blocks charge attacks
* Sword
   * Parry sword attacks by matching shape
   * Can deflect ranged attacks
   * Useless against charge attacks

### Offense

Enemy is standing in front of you.

* Sword
   * First hit starts the attack, slash a bunch
   * Enemy ragdolls on death and goes flying
* Mage staff
   * Charge and fire energy blast, charge has to be timed to get most effect - Hold and then release to activate 

## Enemies
